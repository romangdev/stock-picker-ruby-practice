# stock-picker-ruby-practice

Practicing things I've learned in Ruby by creating a stock picker method.

The method takes an array argument containing elements which represent stock prices on certain days.
Then the method outputs an array containing just 2 elements: an element for  best day to buy 
in relation to an element for the best day to sell for the largest profit... taking into account
you must buy before you can sell.
